# Glyphtrace — Roadmap (High-Level Direction)

This roadmap outlines how Glyphtrace is expected to evolve over time.
It is intentionally high-level and **non-prescriptive**. It does not bind implementation, timelines,
or specification scope — only the general developmental arc of the concept.

The roadmap will grow as Glyphtrace matures.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (current stage)

- Establish core repository structure
- Define conceptual purpose and scope
- Maintain draft specification and early examples
- Produce initial demo for round-trip compression/expansion

Focus: *clarity, articulation, epistemic framing.*

---

## Phase 2 — Expressive Syntax & Symbol Grammar

- Develop early trace grammar expressing minimal epistemic information
- Explore symbolic formats for claims, methods, provenance, evidence
- Begin forming a consistent syntax while retaining flexibility

Focus: *semantic density without ambiguity.*

---

## Phase 3 — Specification Hardening

- Move from conceptual notes to formal spec
- Define validation expectations and compliance rules
- Enable reproducibility and machine interpretability

Focus: *turning an idea into a standard.*

---

## Phase 4 — Tooling Exploration

- Prototype a reversible Glyphtrace converter
- Round-trip testing: document → trace → reconstruction
- Investigate representation formats for CLI/API/plugin workflows

Focus: *practical utility over theoretical completeness.*

---

## Phase 5 — Integration Into Waveframe Labs Ecosystem

- Consider alignment surface with AWO workflow phases
- Potential future interoperability with Forge, CRI-CORE, or metadata stamp
- Evaluate GitHub/Zenodo citation linkages using trace tokens

Focus: *interoperability, not dependency.*

---

## Phase 6 — Stabilization & Publication

- Review design through applied cases
- Refine grammar, documentation, examples, converter behavior
- Publish formal concept explainer
- Candidate for DOI-bound stable standard release

Focus: *becoming a durable research artifact.*

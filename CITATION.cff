abstract: |
  Glyphtrace is a symbolic epistemic compression framework designed for encoding research artifacts,
  claims, workflows, and reasoning structures into compact symbolic traces that can be expanded,
  reconstructed, or audited by human or AI systems. Unlike traditional data compression, Glyphtrace
  condenses meaning rather than bytes — preserving the minimal semantic information required to
  regenerate a scientific artifact with provenance and logical structure intact. This enables
  reproducibility, long‑horizon verifiability, low‑bandwidth referencing, and machine‑interpretable
  epistemic lineage across research ecosystems. Glyphtrace is developed under Waveframe Labs as an
  open research standard governed by the Aurora Research Initiative. It is currently exploratory
  and pre‑standardization, serving as a conceptual foundation for future tooling, converters, and
  provenance‑aware workflows.

# Glyphtrace Converter Sketch — v0.0.1

This document outlines an **early design sketch** for a future Glyphtrace converter — a tool that ingests a document, claim, or scientific artifact and produces a compact symbolic trace. Future versions will support trace → expansion reconstruction.

## Goals

- Convert structured claims → Glyphtrace tokens
- Enable reversible expansion into human/AI-readable reasoning
- Maintain semantic minimality while preserving core meaning

Future development pending formal syntax specification.
